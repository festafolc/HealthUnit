# HealthUnit


"Health Unit" is a JAVA CLI application, essential to managing a unit's customers, its professionals, and the appointments related to those entities.

# About the project
This project was born as a key component to pass my OOP classes while a Computer Engineering student. A document was released with the requirements and business rules that needed to be followed and, in this sense, the project was developed.

# How to run?
At least Java Development Kit 8 is needed. You'll need to run the "Program.java" file, then the program will start. There isn't still a user's manual. If you need instructions about how to use it, please e-mail me.
